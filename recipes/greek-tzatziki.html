<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This is the best tzatziki recipe, and it only gets better with time. Serve with pita bread, in gyros, on lamb, or with whatever you like!</p>
<p>Feel free to experiment (or substitute entirely) with 1 to 3 tablespoons of freshly chopped cilantro (aka coriander) and/or parsley in place of or in addition to the recipe's call for dill. 
    You may also wish to try adding some heat by adding one (and only 1) Serrano pepper (they look like really skinny fingers and come in colors of green and red) to your Tzatzeki recipe 
    (chopped finely). But beware of adding too much heat: those rounded and colorful chilis (called Habanero peppers) are way too hot and will ruin your Tzatzek yogurt dip). 
    The only other veggie i would add would be finely chopped onion.</p>
