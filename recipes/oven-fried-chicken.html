  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>
    I love fried chicken, but it takes so long and is such a big mess. I came up
    with this oven-fried version, and have been making it ever since! Everyone I
    have given the recipe to has loved it as well.
  </p>

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul class="ul-list">
      <li>
        <p>Chicken</p>
        This recipe calls for 12 chicken thighs, but you could also use breasts,
        legs, wings, or drumsticks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Flour</p>
        All-purpose flour adds crispness, seals in moisture, and encourages
        browning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bread Crumbs</p>
        You can use store-bought Italian-seasoned bread crumbs or make your own
        at home.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Eggs</p>
        Whole eggs add moisture and give the flour and bread crumbs something to
        stick to.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Seasonings</p>
        This oven-fried chicken is simply seasoned with salt and pepper, plus a
        little paprika for subtle heat and smoky flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Oil</p>
        Vegetable oil keeps the chicken moist and juicy. Canola oil or olive oil
        would also work well for this recipe.
      </li>
    </ul>

      just writing this as placeholder text. Google it :)
